# Bubble Chart
Server side D3 visual with configuration editor

---
### Quick Start:

This is a fully functional bubble chart visual. At the moment, it does not support drill down. To add to your plugin you just need to 

```javascript
require('./bubble-chart')(server)
```

to your plugin definition.

### Creating other visuals:

'visual/tree-map.js' is another example D3 visual that you can swap in for bubble-chart. There are tons of D3 visual examples online.
